							<h3>VFX Module video</h3>
							<p>The video above shows the VFX's' I created during my 9 week module of learning VFX in Unreal Engine.</p>
							<p>I really enjoyed learning how to create VFX in Unreal Engine and I definitely plan on continuning my learning in the near future.</p>
							<h3>What are the VFX's I created?</h3>
							<p>I created a character to assist me with the creation of my VFX's. The character I thought of was a goblin king who came from a distant world.</p>
							<p>Effect 1: The first effect I created was a 'Special Ability Effect'. This effect spawns an orb around the player which is supposed to act as a defensive shield. An effect then spawns from the ground which resembles a portal to the goblins home planet. Once this effect was created, I couldn't help but feel as though something was missing so I added in small orbs that spawn above the portal.</p>
							<p>Effect 2: My second effect was an enviromental effect. I decided to create an eye that blinks. In a working game, I would have liked to have the eyes follow the player as they move around the map. This effect is relevant to my character as I had the idea that behind the eyes are the goblin kings companions ensuring he is safe on his mission. To create this effect I followed a YouTube tutorial mainly for the blink mechanism. Along with this, I also created a swirl effect that I placed around the eye with a beam that appears to exit the pupil.</p>
							<p>
								Effect 3: The third effect I created is a healing effect. To create this I made a flipbook of crosses and made them spawn a random section of the flipbook in a random area between the boundry. The boundry is my own design too of which i created using a kaleidoscope website. I created this to be black and white and had to use a website to remove the background so I was able to change the colour of it in Unreal. The boundry slowly rotates. The final part of my heal effect is the beams that slowly rise from the ground.
							</p>
							<p>Effect 4: My fourth effect is a jump effect. This one was really simple make once I managed to get the sparks to act how I want them to, however I chose to do this because I wanted to test myself with the timing in blueprint. As you can see in the video, the timing was still a little bit off unfortunately, but I do wish to revisit it and fix it.</p>
							<p>Effect 5: My final effect is my recreation of the Valorant spike plant. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this effect because I loved playing around with the spawn time and making the whole effect work in correct time.</p>
